## Introduction

After spending a long period of time taking vendor-style multiple choice certification exams, I reached a point where I felt I could not study theory any further without actually applying it. Exams like AWS Solutions Architect taught me the *best* ways to secure assets, but real corporate environments rarely resemble ideal architecture diagrams.  

I wanted hands-on experience breaking and securing cloud environments rather than memorizing service limits or definitions. My weaker area had always been offensive security, and I wanted a structured way to improve that while still maintaining a defensive mindset. The PwnedLabs AWS Attack & Defense Bootcamp stood out because of its strong **purple-team approach** — not just how to break systems, but how to understand, detect, and secure them afterwards.  

My long-term goal is to work deeper in Cloud Security, and this program filled a gap that traditional certification paths simply did not provide.

## Bootcamp Overview

The PwnedLabs Amazon Cloud Attack & Defense Bootcamp is a multi-session live program focused on realistic AWS offensive and defensive tradecraft. It blends live instruction, lab environments, community interaction, and self-paced reinforcement.

Key characteristics of the bootcamp:

- Live weekly sessions with recordings available afterwards  
- Private Discord channels for resources, support, and discussion  
- Lifetime access to exclusive bootcamp labs  
- 45-day access to premium labs across the PwnedLabs platform  
- Hands-on, scenario-driven learning rather than lecture-heavy content  
- Emphasis on purple-team methodology rather than pure offense  

The flexibility of having both live sessions and recorded material allowed me to learn at my own pace while still benefiting from a cohort environment.

## What I Learned

Throughout the bootcamp, each session built directly on the last. It felt natural as I went from basic enumeration to full exploitation and then into detection and response. That structure made the learning feel natural rather than overwhelming.

### Session 1 - Starting out with AWS Red Teaming

Coming in with very litte red team background, this was honestly the perfect starting point for me. It was practical, hands-on, and gave me a strong footing to prepare for each of the upcoming labs.

High-level overview, we covered things like:
- Using the AWS CLI effectively  
- Enumerating AWS accounts, services, and identities  
- Secrets scanning  
- Password spraying concepts within AWS environments

### Session 2 - Exploiting IAM and Attack Paths

This session is where we learned the criticality of understanding IAM. Instead of focusing on how to design least-privilege policies, we flipped the perspective. We looked at how overly permissive roles exist in real environments, and how attackers treat those roles as leverage points.

High-level overview:
- Enumerating IAM permissions  
- Exploiting overly permissive IAM roles
- Visualizing IAM attack paths
- Abusing trust relationships and role assumption chains

### Session 3 - Attack and Defend Resources

This was by far the most technically intense session. We moved past analyzing identity paths and started actively breaking vulnerable services like S3, EC2, and Beanstalk. Seeing how small misconfigurations cascade into major exposure really changes how you look at cloud environments.

Some key areas were:
- Public S3 Abuse  
- Instace Metadata Service Abuse
- Finding common web exploits in public resources  
- Detecting abuse with CloudTrail and GuardDuty  

### Session 4 - Purple Teaming

This last session was the one that I actually looked forward to the most. The majority of the people taking the bootcamp are people who want the get the Amazon Cloud **Red** Team Professional cert. But for me I love defending. Finding new ways to create detections while tripping up the attempts of an attacker is exactly what I wanted to learn.

Highlights include:
- AWS-native security stack for incident response and detection
- Creating honeypots with Canary Tokens
- Emulating threat actors to test detection pipelines
- Leveraging developer resources as attack vectors

_What I want to point out by the way is seeing tooling like canaries, which is something I actively work with in my full-time role, reinforced that this training isn't theoretical. It reflects real-world security operations._

## What I Appreciated Most

The realism of the labs was the most impactful aspect of the bootcamp. These were not gimmicky capture-the-flag challenges; they were modeled after real attack tradecraft observed by professional offensive security practitioners.

Not only that but although I purchased the course in December, it was still being updated with new demos showcasing new attacks. The platform consistently felt like it was evolving and expanding rather than remaining static.

## How I Prepared for the ACRTP Exam

Although this bootcamp provides a lot for you, I wasn't going to be naive either. This exam is no joke and personally not having red-team experience I knew I would have to prepare for the exam.

### Note-Taking and Documentation

Documentation became a huge part of my preparation. I realized quickly that trying to do everything during the live sessions wasn't sustainable. Instead, I focused on rewriting labs in my own words after completing them. The same can be applied to academy labs. Every lab has a walkthrough but  I forced myself to not rely on it. If I couldn't what I did and why it worked, I wasn't ready.

Note taking is critical. Be sure to take notes after each session as its really hard to do everything during session time. Not only that, create your own writeups. Yes every lab on the platform has a walkthrough but it doesn't mean you have to rely on it.

- Writing my own walkthroughs 
- Maintaining a command reference sheet  
- Summarizing each session after completion  

### Repetition

Aristotle once said, "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.", and that lines up exactly with what we're doing here. By repeating the labs, you're natrually building that attacker mindset which is needed for this exam.

- Re-running the bootcamp environment two to three times  
- Performing labs without walkthroughs to build natural problem-solving ability  

### External Practice

I also attempted Electra. It's solid practice and definitely simulates what an attacker would have to do within a real enterprise environment, but, it goes deeper that what you need for the exam. My main focus was the bootcamp and Academy CTF challenges. I created writeups for them in Notion and treated them like black-box engagements.

- Completing red-team CTF-tagged labs  
- Created personal writeups in Notion
- Treating exercises as black-box engagements 

### Tool Familiarity

The tools used throughout the bootcamp show up repeatedly. I made sure I wasn’t just running them, I wanted to understand what they were actually enumerating. I also built small scripts to fill gaps where automation didn’t give me full visibility.

The tools I personally used the most:
- AWS-Enumerator  
- Pacu  
- CloudFox  
- Small custom scripts for enumeration

## ACRTP Exam Experience (High Level)

The Amazon Cloud Red Team Professional exam is a **24-hour hands-on pentest environment** where starting credentials are provided and no hints are given. The experience is entirely self-driven and tests endurance as much as technical knowledge.

For my attempt:

- Completion time was approximately 14 hours  
- Mentally exhausting but fair  
- Time management and documentation were critical  
- Stress management played a larger role than expected

_There were plenty of times I was ready to hurl my 2019 Macbook Pro through a window but that's what the exam wants you to do. Take a break, play some Rematch, yell at that, then head back to the exam._

Relative difficulty from my perspective:

1. Electra Cyber Range – most difficult  
2. ACRTP Exam – challenging but manageable  
3. Bootcamp Capstone CTF – strong preparation stepping stone  

If someone can comfortably complete the capstone CTF, they are likely prepared for the exam environment.

## Tips for Future Candidates

- Take detailed notes **after** sessions rather than trying to capture everything live  
- Re-do labs at least once without a walkthrough  
- Practice CTF-style labs independently  
- Maintain a command reference sheet  
- Document every step of your progress during practice  
- Develop manual enumeration habits  
- Build strong IAM understanding  
- Do not rely solely on automated tools

## Final Thoughts

The PwnedLabs platform significantly strengthened my offensive cloud security skills while reinforcing defensive awareness. It filled a gap that traditional certifications could not address because it focused on *application* rather than memorization.

While some HR departments may not recognize the platform name the same way they recognize long-standing certification vendors, the technical depth and practical exposure gained are undeniable. The community is active, the content is continuously improving, and the expansion into areas like Kubernetes and blue-team labs shows long-term commitment.

For anyone serious about developing real-world cloud security skills rather than only passing exams, this experience provided some of the most in-depth and up-to-date tradecraft I have encountered.
