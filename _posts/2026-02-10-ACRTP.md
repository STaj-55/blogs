## Introduction

After spending a long period of time taking vendor-style multiple choice certification exams, I reached a point where I felt I could not study theory any further without actually applying it. Exams like AWS Solutions Architect taught me the *best* ways to secure assets, but real corporate environments rarely resemble ideal architecture diagrams.  

I wanted hands-on experience breaking and securing cloud environments rather than memorizing service limits or definitions. My weaker area had always been offensive security, and I wanted a structured way to improve that while still maintaining a defensive mindset. The PwnedLabs AWS Attack & Defense Bootcamp stood out because of its strong **purple-team approach** — not just how to break systems, but how to understand, detect, and secure them afterwards.  

My long-term goal is to work deeper in Cloud Security, and this program filled a gap that traditional certification paths simply did not provide.

## Bootcamp Overview

The PwnedLabs Amazon Cloud Attack & Defense Bootcamp is a multi-session live program focused on realistic AWS offensive and defensive tradecraft. It blends live instruction, lab environments, community interaction, and self-paced reinforcement.

Key characteristics of the bootcamp:

- Live weekly sessions with recordings available afterwards  
- Private Discord channels for resources, support, and discussion  
- Lifetime access to exclusive bootcamp labs  
- 45-day access to premium labs across the PwnedLabs platform  
- Hands-on, scenario-driven learning rather than lecture-heavy content  
- Emphasis on purple-team methodology rather than pure offense  

The flexibility of having both live sessions and recorded material allowed me to learn at my own pace while still benefiting from a cohort environment.

## What I Learned

Rather than thinking of the program as separate “sessions,” it is more accurate to describe the learning in terms of skill areas.

### IAM and Identity Enumeration

- Understanding trust policies and role assumption paths  
- Enumerating users, groups, and roles effectively  
- Recognizing overly permissive policies  
- Identifying privilege escalation opportunities  
- Role chaining and persistence concepts  

### Resource Exploitation

- S3 misconfigurations and public access issues  
- EC2 exploitation paths and instance metadata exposure concepts  
- Discovering secrets in repositories and storage  
- Manual enumeration techniques alongside automated tooling  

### Detection and Defense

- CloudTrail visibility and event interpretation  
- Behavioral detection thinking rather than signature reliance  
- Recognizing how attackers evade logging  
- Strengthening defensive awareness while performing offensive actions  

### Mindset Shifts

- Tools are helpful, but manual enumeration is critical  
- Documentation discipline is non-negotiable  
- Attack paths are dynamic and situational  
- Understanding *why* a misconfiguration matters is more important than memorizing commands

## What I Appreciated Most

The realism of the labs was the most impactful aspect of the bootcamp. These were not gimmicky capture-the-flag challenges; they were modeled after real attack tradecraft observed by professional offensive security practitioners.

Additional highlights included:

- Labs based on real-world scenarios rather than contrived exercises  
- Lifetime access to the bootcamp lab environment  
- 45 days of premium platform access  
- Zoom recordings for review and reinforcement  
- Flexible pacing — learn live or asynchronously  
- Strong and responsive community support  
- Balanced offensive and defensive perspectives  

The platform consistently felt like it was evolving and expanding rather than remaining static.

## How I Prepared for the ACRTP Exam

Preparation extended beyond simply attending the sessions. Repetition and independent practice were essential.

### Note-Taking and Documentation

- Writing my own walkthroughs for each lab  
- Maintaining a command reference sheet  
- Summarizing each session after completion rather than during  

### Repetition

- Re-running the bootcamp environment two to three times  
- Performing labs without walkthroughs to build natural problem-solving ability  

### External Practice

- Completing academy red-team labs on the platform  
- Attempting CTF-tagged labs multiple times  
- Treating exercises as black-box engagements rather than guided tasks  

### Tool Familiarity

- AWS-Enumerator  
- Pacu  
- CloudFox  
- Building small manual scripts to avoid over-reliance on automation

## ACRTP Exam Experience (High Level)

The Amazon Cloud Red Team Professional exam is a **24-hour hands-on pentest environment** where starting credentials are provided and no hints are given. The experience is entirely self-driven and tests endurance as much as technical knowledge.

For my attempt:

- Completion time was approximately 14 hours  
- Mentally exhausting but fair  
- Time management and documentation were critical  
- Stress management played a larger role than expected  

Relative difficulty from my perspective:

1. Electra Cyber Range – most difficult  
2. ACRTP Exam – challenging but manageable  
3. Bootcamp Capstone CTF – strong preparation stepping stone  

If someone can comfortably complete the capstone CTF, they are likely prepared for the exam environment.

## Tips for Future Candidates

- Take detailed notes **after** sessions rather than trying to capture everything live  
- Re-do labs at least once without a walkthrough  
- Practice CTF-style labs independently  
- Maintain a command reference sheet  
- Document every step of your progress during practice  
- Develop manual enumeration habits  
- Build strong IAM understanding  
- Do not rely solely on automated tools

## Final Thoughts

The PwnedLabs platform significantly strengthened my offensive cloud security skills while reinforcing defensive awareness. It filled a gap that traditional certifications could not address because it focused on *application* rather than memorization.

While some HR departments may not recognize the platform name the same way they recognize long-standing certification vendors, the technical depth and practical exposure gained are undeniable. The community is active, the content is continuously improving, and the expansion into areas like Kubernetes and blue-team labs shows long-term commitment.

For anyone serious about developing real-world cloud security skills rather than only passing exams, this experience provided some of the most in-depth and up-to-date tradecraft I have encountered.
